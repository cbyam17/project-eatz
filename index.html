	<h1>Welcome to Project Eatz</h1>
	<p>
In today’s fast paced world, you’ve got places to be and access to everything on the go. Why should your cookbook be any different? Cooking is an experience to share your special creation with special people. Imagine you want to impress friends or family with that perfect recipe you made a few months ago, but you can’t quite remember which herbs you used or the ratio of flour to water.
